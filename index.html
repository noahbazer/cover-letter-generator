        <p>Dear LEADPOINT Digital,</p>
        <p>
          As I've started my search for front-end development work, I've been
          seeking out studios and companies that have an eye for design and a
          passion for building beautiful solutions. It's obvious to me that
          LEADPOINT is more about just making money in the marketing field; It's
          about creating a lasting impact on the world through the work that you
          do. I'm excited about the opportunity to be a part of that mission.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the last 2+ years, I've been honing my skills in front-end web
          development and design. I've worked on a variety of projects, from
          small business websites to full-scale web applications. I've learned
          to work with a variety of technologies, including HTML, CSS,
          JavaScript, React, as well as content management systems like
          WordPress, GoDaddy, Wix, and more. I've also learned to use design
          tools like Adobe Photoshop to create beautiful, user-friendly
          interfaces. Furthermore, I'm skilled with version control systems like
          Git to collaborate with other developers and manage my codebase. If
          there is a technology or tool that the company uses that I'm not
          familiar with, I'm confident that I can learn it quickly and
          effectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          With over 9 years of work experience in various fields, I've gained a
          lot of solid communication skills, and can adapt to any team with a
          positive attitude. I'm a quick learner, and I'm always looking for
          ways to improve my skills and knowledge. I'm confident that I can
          bring a lot of value to the team at LEADPOINT Digital.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am beyond eager to relocate and begin work, especially with a
          company that is so dedicated to making a difference in the world. My
          portfolio and socials are listed at the top of this page, and I would
          be happy to provide any additional information you may need. Thank you
          for considering me for this position, and I look forward to hearing
          form you soon!
        </p>
        <p>Sincerely,<br />Noah Bazer</p>
